# Scripts
A collection of scripts that I maintain to make my life easier.

## logs
**Who?** Me. Also whomever made [multitail](https://github.com/halturin/multitail), which is the core of this script.

**What?** It's a logfile monitor-er.

**When?** After nearly losing my mind several times during development typing absolute paths to logfiles.

**Where?** Any server which has logs.

**Why?** Sometimes you just need to see the same things every day, all at once, and in realtime.

## newsite
**Who?** Me, on behalf of my company and my annoyed fingers.

**What?** It sets up new Apache VirtualHosts.

**When?** After manually configuring the umpty-millionth VirtualHost that looked almost identical to all the others hosted next to it.

**Where?** Apache webservers on which you find yourself frequently launching new sites, and you're not paid hourly to maintain.

**Why?** Typing the same stuff a lot is boring.
